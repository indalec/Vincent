"That was a nice kiss..."

"Meet Vincent.
He's feeling blue.
A sweet kiss might just make his day!"

"You're giving Vincent a kiss..."

"Oh no, Vincent didn't feel that one.
Try a longer kiss!"

"*smack*"

"Vincent is overwhelmed with joy
thanks to your kisses!"

"... but he's still feeling blue.
Almost there! Another kiss might be
just what Vincent needs."

"Hold tight!
Keep pressing to show some love!"

"So close! Vincent felt that one,
but let's try for a longer kiss."

"There you go! With that kiss,
Vincent's day is brighter, and so is yours.
Now you can go further with your life!"
